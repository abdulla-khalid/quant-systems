Trading systems using quantitative methods.

The purpose of this project is to use an LSTM Neural Network Model to make the prediction whether price is likely to increase or decrease. Using the output of the model, we built a trading strategy to buy and sell using the Blankly Framework. 

The model and strategy can be found inside main.ipynb. To run the project, make sure to have installed the packages from requirements.txt.
